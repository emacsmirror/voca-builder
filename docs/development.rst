Development
===========



The mission of voca-builder is to help user to improve their English
language skills by building up their vocabularies. It depends on the
open software and free-of-charge online dictionary database, and
therefore it is an open software. The source code can be found at the
`yitang/voca-builder <https://github.com/yitang/voca-builder>`_ repository on GitHub.

I intent to update it regularly to account for its dependence's
upgrading, and also to provides more features. But I am not an Emacs
Lisp expert and I am actively seek collaboration. Any contribution to
this package in terms of code or suggestion will be highly
appreciated.

My current development plan:

First Release - 0.1.0 - 2015-04-05
----------------------------------



The first release of voca-builder has built a platform that user can
look-up and records with new vocabularies.

The second release of voca-builder should focus on helping user to
memorise the vocabulary.

memorising.
